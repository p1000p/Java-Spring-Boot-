# Photo Portfolio
### Website Using Java
**Project Description:** Our project is a photo portfolio website built using Spring Boot. It serves as a platform for photographers to showcase their work, allowing users to browse through different photos, search for specific images, and even upload their own photos to contribute to the portfolio. The website is designed to be user-friendly, with intuitive navigation and a visually appealing interface. With features like image categorization, search functionality, and user authentication, our project aims to provide a seamless experience for both photographers and visitors alike.
#### Technologies Used:

Using DSA in Java with Spring Boot: In our project, we utilize DSA concepts within our Java codebase to optimize various functionalities. For example, we might use data structures like maps or sets to efficiently store and retrieve data, or algorithms like sorting or searching to process large datasets. By leveraging DSA, we ensure that our application performs optimally and can handle complex operations with ease.
